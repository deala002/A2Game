## Adding a task

Conveying a checkpoint in a task is beneficial due to being aware of how long people have until the next or overall in the meeting. There are two boxes to fill out, the name of the task and the timer that the user can set how many minutes the task will go for. This will be saved in the list above upon clicking the "Add Task" button. The heading timer will collect all the time needed to complete all tasks.

## Running the timer

Once a timer is added, the "Start" button runs the timer from its current point in time. It also acts as a "Pause" button, where you can freeze the timer.

"Reset" sets the timer back to its built time limit in a frozen state to be able to run again. "Skip" will make the timer jump to the end time of a single task, and "+1 min" adds an additional minute to the timer.

"Remove Task" will take out the newest task added to the agenda.

## Imports and Exports

Accepting the data in "csv" files, the program also allows users to take in and out arranged data for the timer. To save an agenda, press "Export Tasks". This will download a csv into your file directory. You can call back to this by selecting the file after pressing "Choose File".
